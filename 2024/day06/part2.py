Where to even begin with this one?
Is it ugly? Oh my god yes.
Is it slow? Absolutely: takes about 2 minutes to complete.
Does it produce the correct answer? After working on this for SO MANY hours.... YES, it does work.

I am pretty frustrated that it took this long and is essentially just the same idea I had to begin with:
Run two simulations: one simulates the guard's path from the starting position until it either gets
stuck in a loop or goes out of bounds, and one that simulates adding an obstacle at each point along
the guard's normal uninterrupted path.

I couldn't figure out a way to do this without running TWO recursive loops, one nested inside the other.
The outer loop controls the blocking simulation and ends when the next block position would be out of bounds.
The inner loop controls the guard and ends when it detects a loop or goes out of bounds.

It sounds conceptually simple but I found implementing it to be a huge pain in the ass and I have
to imagine there are better ways. I cannot understand how some people's solutions run in milliseconds.

The only other idea I had was to look for squares, but a loop can be any shape so that doesn't work.

Time to move on, I guess. Usually I go back and beautify my code a bit but this time I think I'm going
to leave it as-is.
